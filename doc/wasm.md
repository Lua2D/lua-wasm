# Building and running the wasm artifact

Operational reference for the `wasm` / `wasm-lib` Makefile targets. The README
covers *what* the artifact is and where it stands; this file covers *how* to
build, run, and embed it, plus the sharp edges.

## Toolchain

**clang 20+** with a wasi-libc sysroot (the default EH encoding needs LLVM 20 —
see the encoding section below). `WASM_CLANGXX` and `WASM_SYSROOT` are override
points for a custom compiler or a self-built sysroot:

```bash
make wasm                                            # /usr sysroot, clang++-20
make wasm WASM_CLANGXX=clang++ WASM_SYSROOT=/opt/wasi-sysroot
```

On hosts without a packaged clang 20, `zig c++` is a self-contained clang-20+
driver with its own wasi sysroot (`pip install ziglang`), witnessed for this
exact build:

```bash
make wasm WASM_CLANGXX="python3 -m ziglang c++" WASM_SYSROOT= \
  WASM_EXTRA="-Xclang -target-feature -Xclang +exception-handling"
```

(The `-Xclang` pair works around zig's own CPU-feature mapping not enabling the
wasm EH feature that `-fwasm-exceptions` implies under plain clang.)

Running the artifact needs a WASI host with wasm exception-handling support —
Node ≥ 24.15, a current browser, or wasmtime via `scripts/wasmtime-run.py`
(see the encoding section for which hosts take which encoding; Node 24.0–24.14
compile the artifact only with `--experimental-wasm-exnref` — the sweep is in
the audit's 2026-07-06 addendum).

## Exception-handling runtime: `WASM_EH`

Lua's error handling lowers onto the wasm exception-handling proposal (the
artifact compiles as C++ so `LUAI_THROW`/`LUAI_TRY` become `throw`/`catch`).
Two modes select who owns exception dispatch:

| `WASM_EH` | what owns dispatch | semantics | libc++abi |
| - | - | - | - |
| `internal` (default) | the self-contained micro-runtime in `src/onelua.c` | `catch(...)` only — no type matching, no destructors | none needed |
| `external` | a real libc++abi built with `-fwasm-exceptions` | full typed catches | you supply it |

Use `external` when the host embedding Lua has **its own** C++ that needs
*typed* catches — Lua errors and the host's exceptions must then travel one
coherent EH domain, which the bundled `catch(...)`-only shim cannot provide.
It is gated behind `-DLUAW_EXTERNAL_EH`, which suppresses the shim so the
external runtime's `__cxa_*` symbols are the only ones present:

```bash
make wasm WASM_EH=external \
  WASM_EH_FLAGS="-L/path/to/rt/lib" \
  WASM_EH_LIBS="-lc++ -lc++abi /path/to/libunwind_wasm.a"
```

No distro ships a libc++abi built with wasm-EH (zig's bundled one included) —
`examples/embed/build-eh.sh` is the in-tree recipe that builds one from zig's
bundled LLVM runtime sources in seconds, and the CI witness that proves typed
catches work through it. `doc/embedding.md` covers when an embedder needs this
mode.

### Hazard: the micro-shim wins silently

Linking a real libc++abi **without** `WASM_EH=external` (i.e. without
`-DLUAW_EXTERNAL_EH`) produces **no** duplicate-symbol error. The bundled
shim's `__cxa_*` definitions satisfy every reference, so the archive members
are simply never pulled — you end up on `catch(...)`-only semantics without any
diagnostic. `WASM_EH=external` closes this two ways: it removes the shim so a
missing external runtime becomes a *link* error, and the target runs a
post-build fingerprint check (`grep` for the libc++abi terminate string in the
artifact) that fails the build if the external runtime was not actually linked.

## Running the official test suite under wasm

WASI has no shell, so `tests/main.lua`'s `assert(os.execute(...))` and the other
non-portable checks cannot pass under the wasm build. The suite's own
portability switch, `_port=true`, skips exactly those. It is **required** here,
not optional:

```bash
cd tests
node ../scripts/wasm-run.mjs ../lua.wasm -e"_port=true" all.lua
```

Note the **attached** form `-e"_port=true"` (no space). `-e <chunk>` also works,
but a following argument that itself begins with `--` (as some suite files and
ad-hoc chunks do) is ambiguous to the standalone interpreter's argument scan;
`-e<chunk>` avoids it. This matters most when driving the artifact purely
through `argv` — the natural path when there is no filesystem to load from.

The same suite runs under wasmtime — the non-V8 cross-check:

```bash
pip install wasmtime
cd tests
python3 ../scripts/wasmtime-run.py ../lua.wasm -e"_port=true" all.lua
# → final OK !!!
```

Two more witnesses ride the same artifacts, both CI-enforced: the browser leg
(`node scripts/browser-witness.mjs lua.wasm tests/suite-prefix-bundle.lua --engine <chromium|firefox|webkit>` —
regenerate the bundle first with `python3 scripts/suite-bundle.py`; needs
playwright-core + the requested browser) and the reactor battery
(`node scripts/reactor-stress.mjs lua-lib.wasm`). `--engine` is required and
the driver refuses to report a pass unless the page truly ran on that engine;
CI runs all three, with Chromium (V8) gating and Firefox/WebKit non-gating
until their wasm-EH support is confirmed (#42).

## EH encoding: `WASM_EH_ENCODING`

Wasm exception handling exists in two wire formats, and hosts differ on which
they accept. `WASM_EH_ENCODING` selects the one the artifact carries:

| `WASM_EH_ENCODING` | instructions | build needs | runs on |
| - | - | - | - |
| `standard` (default) | `try_table`/`exnref` (the standardized format) | LLVM 20+ | V8 with default-on exnref (Node ≥ 24.15, current browsers; Node 24.0–24.14 need `--experimental-wasm-exnref`), wasmtime and other non-V8 runtimes |
| `legacy` | `try`/`catch` (pre-standard) | clang 18/19 suffice | V8 engines only; wasmtime rejects it (`legacy_exceptions feature required`) |

Witnessed on this pin (zig c++ / clang 20.1.2; engines: wasmtime 36,
Chromium 141 = V8 14.1, Node 22 = V8 12.4):

- `standard`: full suite passes under wasmtime; suite-prefix witness passes in
  Chromium 141. On Node 22 (V8's *experimental* exnref, `--experimental-wasm-exnref`)
  it still host-crashes — that V8 generation is broken on both paths; use Node ≥ 24.15.
- `legacy`: rejected by wasmtime; passes the suite-prefix witness on
  Chromium 141; host-crashes old V8 (the audit's original finding).

`legacy` exists only as a bridge for toolchains stuck below clang 20 targeting
browsers/Node exclusively; there is no other reason to choose it.
