# verify-stock.sh -- witness that the vendored Lua core is verbatim stock
# 5.4.8 except for the one file we knowingly changed.
#
# The fork vendors PUC-Rio Lua 5.4.8 and modifies exactly one file:
# luac.c (the assert-safe bytecode-listing rework described in UPDATING:
# stock luac hoists GETARG_* into locals, which trips lua_assert on
# opcodes lacking those argument formats under -DLUAI_ASSERT; found by
# this witness's first CI run -- it was inherited from the lua-aot import,
# undeclared). Until v0.2.0 there were five modified files: lobject.h,
# lfunc.c, lvm.c, and luaconf.h carried AOT hooks, now removed with AOT.
# This script diffs every source
# file present in both the official release and src/:
#   - a file outside the known-modified set that differs   -> FAIL
#   - a known-modified file that is byte-identical to stock -> FAIL (the
#     modified list has gone stale)
# Files unique to this repo (the onelua monolith, the WASI shims) are
# reported, not diffed.
#
# Network: by default this fetches the release from lua.org. Run it where
# outbound HTTPS to lua.org is permitted -- locally, or the CI job in #3;
# some sandboxes deny that egress. To diff against an already-extracted
# tree instead of downloading, set LUA_SRC_DIR to its src/ directory.
